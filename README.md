![Baton — orchestrate WordPress workflows with the Abilities API](assets/images/baton-banner.png)

# Baton

A conductor’s wand, properly called a baton, is a thin, lightweight stick used by music directors to amplify and guide physical gestures.

Baton is a WordPress plugin that adds a thin, lightweight layer used by admins to orchestrate site workflows based on the WP [Abilities API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities/). It provides field-level input mapping to control data passing between registered Abilities, and each workflow is also exposed as it's own Ability (`baton/workflow-{id}`) for nesting or use in external tooling.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.9+
- PHP 7.4+

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into `wp-content/plugins/baton`.
2. Activate **Baton** in the WordPress Plugins screen.

Prebuilt editor assets are included in `build/` — you do not need Node or npm to use the plugin.

## Usage

**Tools → Baton** — create workflows in the visual editor (vertical step cards, data filters on connectors), run them from the admin, and reference saved workflows as `baton/workflow-{post_id}` in other workflows.

## Building the editor UI

Only needed when changing files under `src/`. The workflow editor is a React bundle built with `@wordpress/scripts`:

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/baton   # or your clone path
npm install
npm run build
```

After making any changes within `src/`, run `npm run build` (or `npm start` while developing). The built files land in `build/` and are enqueued on the workflow edit screen.
