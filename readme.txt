Orchestrate WordPress Abilities into custom workflows with a no-code visual editor.

== Description ==

A conductor’s wand, properly called a baton, is a thin, lightweight stick used by music directors to amplify and guide physical gestures.

Baton is a WordPress plugin that adds a thin, lightweight layer used by admins to orchestrate site workflows based on the WP [Abilities API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities/). 

It provides field-level input mapping to control data passing between registered Abilities, and each workflow is also registered as it's own Ability (`baton/workflow-{id}`) for nesting or use in external tooling.

**Features:**

* Visual workflow editor with ability steps and data filters between steps
* Input mapping from static workflow input or the previous step's output
* Each published workflow registers as its own ability for nesting and tooling
* Cycle detection when workflows call each other
* Prebuilt editor assets in `build/` — no Node.js required to use the plugin

**Requirements:** WordPress 6.9 or later (Abilities API). PHP 7.4 or later.

== Installation ==

**From WordPress.org**
1. Install Baton through the WordPress plugin directory
2. Activate **Baton** through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Go to **Tools > Baton** and queue the orchestra!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does Baton require WordPress 6.9? =

Baton depends on the Abilities API (`wp_register_ability`, `wp_get_abilities`, and related APIs) introduced in WordPress 6.9. On older versions, the plugin shows an admin notice and does not load workflow features.

= Can I run workflows from the REST API or WP-CLI? =

Each saved workflow is registered as an ability (`baton/workflow-{post_id}`), but workflows are not exposed via `show_in_rest` at this point.

= What happens when I uninstall Baton? =

Baton deletes all `baton_workflow` posts (and their definition meta) when the plugin is removed via the Plugins screen.

== Screenshots ==

1. Workflow list under Tools → Baton
